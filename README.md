# Getting Started

## Use of Gist
   GitHub Gists serve as a quick and easy way to share code snippets, scripts, and text notes. They're often used for:

   * Sharing code snippets during discussions.
   * Storing and sharing configuration files.
   * Collaborating on small projects or assignments.
   * Embedding executable examples in documentation or tutorials.
## You can run this index.js by following steps:
1. Copy the raw file of 'index.js' and paste it to your computer.(or simply you can download it).
2.Set up the requirements by typing this in terminal as follows:
```
npm install
node index.js
```
This will display the output of the gist.

# Obfuscation
Obfuscation means to make something difficult to understand. Programming code is often obfuscated to protect intellectual property or trade secrets, and to prevent an 
attacker from reverse engineering a proprietary software program.

Encrypting some or all of a program's code is one obfuscation method.
