# Obfuscation
Obfuscation means to make something difficult to understand. Programming code is often obfuscated to protect intellectual property or trade secrets, and to prevent an 
attacker from reverse engineering a proprietary software program.

Encrypting some or all of a program's code is one obfuscation method.
